# Structural Damage Detection Application

This application is developed to assist insurance companies by classifying structural damages into "undamaged", "minor damage", "moderate damage", and "heavy damage" categories, aiding in the determination of compensation payouts. The model analyzes damages in photos, classifies them, and provides this crucial information to insurers. This project was presented at the Neova Sigorta Ideathon.
